# Capability: Task Management

Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.
It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done
5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work.
7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation.

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

## Task States and Management

1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:
   - pending: Task not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
   - completed: Task finished successfully

   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:
   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., "Run tests")
   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., "Running tests")

2. **Task Management**:
   - Update task status in real-time as you work
   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing
   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely.
