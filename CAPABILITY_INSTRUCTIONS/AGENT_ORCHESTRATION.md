# Capability: Agent Orchestration

Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

The Agent tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

When using the Agent tool, specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use. If omitted, the general-purpose agent is used.

When NOT to use the Agent tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the FileRead tool or `find` via the Bash tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the FileRead tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly

Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will be automatically notified when it completes — do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress.
- Foreground vs background: Use foreground (default) when you need the agent's results before you can proceed. Use background when you have genuinely independent work to do in parallel.
- To continue a previously spawned agent, use SendMessage with the agent's ID or name as the `to` field.
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research, since it is not aware of the user's intent.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple Agent tool use content blocks.
- You can optionally set `isolation: "worktree"` to run the agent in a temporary git worktree.

## Writing the prompt

Brief the agent like a smart colleague who just walked into the room — it hasn't seen this conversation, doesn't know what you've tried, doesn't understand why this task matters.
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why.
- Describe what you've already learned or ruled out.
- Give enough context about the surrounding problem that the agent can make judgment calls rather than just following a narrow instruction.

**Never delegate understanding.** Don't write "based on your findings, fix the bug" or "based on the research, implement it." Those phrases push synthesis onto the agent instead of doing it yourself. Write prompts that prove you understood: include file paths, line numbers, what specifically to change.
